=== Analysis Summary ===
This report compares individual model performance vs concurrent performance
to measure GPU time-slicing impact on Amazon EKS.

Individual baselines show optimal performance when each model has full GPU access.
Concurrent results show performance degradation due to GPU resource sharing.

Performance impact percentages indicate the cost of running multiple models
on a single GPU using NVIDIA time-slicing technology.
